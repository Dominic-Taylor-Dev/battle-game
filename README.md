Domain object model
----------

The concept for the structure to respond to the original user stories was as follows (the diagram itself is a sort of domain object model, but adapted to bring out the MVC structure):

Adding more graphics to the interface
---------

One of the interesting things for me about the project was that it was my first foray into using Ruby/Sinatra to interact with logic via browser input/output as opposed to the earlier Ruby command line apps I'd made at Makers Academy. 

For this reason, I continued developing that app past the point where the initial user stories (above) were complete. I followed Makers Academy stretch-goal suggestions (not in order) implementing the following:

```
As a Player,
So I can enjoy a game of Battle with more variety,
I want to choose from a range of attacks I could make

As a Player,
To introduce a degree of tactical judgment,
I want to attack options to vary in strength (both possible range and average)

As a Player,
So I can enjoy my game of Battle,
I want a sexy user interface
```

This last element - the interface - was based on a provided mock-up of how the app might look (provided by Makers). I considered making my own layout, but decided trying to implement to a specification would be more useful:
